# Hi I'm aya and I write random stuff with css :D

I self-taught myself css because of some sites I used frequently not having native dark themes, which made them harsher on my eyes when I stayed up late...

I'm not that good at css or anything, shit I don't even know html, this is all just for fun and learning!

I do plan to improve at efficiency, optimization, and use that to make some pretty cool themes for sites and apps I use, so this is a neat way to collect all my stuff in one place!!!
